# 🌦️ Will It Rain On My Parade? - NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025

## 🚀 Overview
A comprehensive Weather Probability Dashboard that transforms NASA's historical Earth observation data into actionable insights for outdoor event planning. This application calculates the likelihood of adverse weather conditions for any location and date using 15+ years of NASA climate data.

## 🎯 Challenge Statement
"Will It Rain On My Parade?" - NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025
Develop an application that enables users to conduct customized queries for weather probability analysis using NASA Earth observation data.

## ✨ Key Features
📍 Interactive Map Interface - Select locations via map clicks or search
📅 Custom Date Selection - Plan events months in advance
🌡️ Multi-Condition Analysis - Probability calculations for:
1.Extreme heat (>90°F) and cold (<32°F)
2. Heavy precipitation (>0.5 inches)
3. High winds (>15 mph)
4. Uncomfortable conditions (heat index)

📊 Visual Analytics - Color-coded probability bars and historical trend charts
